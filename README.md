## PROJECT TOPIC: KULTRA MEGA STORE ANALYSIS

### PROJECT OVERVIEW

This Data analysis project aims to generate insight on sales performance for a mega store specialized in Office supplies and Furniture from 2009 to 2012. By analyzing various parameters in the data received, enough for thorough findings and insights to make an informed decision and more logical course of action.

### Data Sources
The Primary source of Data used here is a CSV Data file from DSA Data Analysis Team
* KMS SQL Case Study
* Order Status

### Tools Used 
- Ms Excel 
   - Data Cleaning and Preparation
- SQL Server
   - For Querying and Analysis

### Data cleaning/preparation
1. 	Data Loading and Inspection
2. 	Check for missing Values

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved the exploring of the data to answer some key questions such as;
-	Which **Product category** had the highest sales? 
-	What are the **Top 3** and **Bottom 3** regions in terms of sales? 
-	What were the **Total sales** of appliances in Ontario? 
-	Who are the **10 bottom customers**?
-	KMS incurred the **most shipping cost** using which **shipping method**?
-	Who are the **most valuable customers**, and what products or services do they typically 
  	 purchase?

-	Which **Consumer Customer** was the most **Profitable one**? 
-	Which Customer **Returned items**, and what **Segment** do they belong to? 
-	Was Shipping cost spent on order of priority as regard the shipping method use (Delivery Truck, Express Air)

### Data Analysis
This includes some basic lines of Code or queries worked with 
- Product Category with the highest Sale

### Results/Findings
This Analysis result is summarized as follow:
+ Sales are made but profit is not consistent – Sales is more for the Technology Product Category compare to others and more prominent in regions of Atlantic, Quebec and Prarie are thriving and we have more that are not doing good which is the wests and Yukon. We found out that the most shipping cost is the Regular Air mode. 

+ The KMS Management are not strict when it comes to discounting which majority of time leads to loss instead of profit, discounting is not a fixed amount.

+ We also got to know our valuable Customers about 10 of them, are those who sales, profit and quantity of order is more if not the highest and the category they belong,

+ We found out the name of the customer whose small business had the highest sale, the corporate customer with a consistent patronage from 2009 to 2012 and Consumer Customer that is profitable to our Store.

+ We went further to check if items were returned and we found out some customer returned items and what business segment they belong to could potentially be due to delay in orders reaching them in time due to lack of urgency and wrong shipping method. 

+ Lastly, we get to see that Shipping cost was never due to Order priority and even the mode or method of shipment did not give a sense of urgency.

### Recommendation
Base on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

•	**Discounting Customers should be Revised**
- A policy should be implemented that guides the application of discount in sales for an agreed number of Orders, anything below should not be applied.
-Only if the Profit Margin is high then discount should be considered.

•	**Promote sales of Product in Technology Category**
 - we deduced during our query that Technology category brings in the most sales so marketing every product under it
   1. Setting defined goals – Give each sales persons a target. A set number of items should be sold out by a set date
   2. Advertise new product to existing customers to try out
   3. Allow for upgrade of those items ordered when they bring it adding small incentives to appeal to them
   4. Ask for referrals and reviews for those items from returning Customers which could be drop on the store website
   5. Add New Payment Method such as instalment
